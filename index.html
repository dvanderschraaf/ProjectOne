                Hey everybody, Im Devon, yall can call me Dev though. I grew up here in the city, specifically in the Misison District. In my free time I enjoy watching anime and making all forms of art. I currently make beats and graphics for other artists. To be honest I need to learn how to create better content and post more content in general. Yall can go check me out in the bottom left corner of any page. I love animals and cooking, though sometimes  I do a little too much with my recipes. I love back scratches and exercising. I have 2 cats and a dog back at home. I also enjoy eating, specifically the food around my neighborhood and PASTA. I work at a skate shop / youth program right now called "San Francisco Skate Club" where we take the kids out to skate around the city, help out with school work and create a lot of art. I also work at an art gallery called "The Drawing Room", where I am a host / doorman during events and a project personnel. 
                <br>
                <br>    
                I am a second year here at San Francisco State, studying under a Visual Communications Major. I am currently working on my design skills in all departments so I can have knowledge to do anything art realted. I want to make money from my art and my energy. I am still thinking about possibly taking a minor in marketing or buisness because I want to be a free lance designer. I want to create a buisness under my name where people can hire me for all of my artistic skills. I would also love to help design content for organizations or programs that help out people and the world. More specifically helping under recourcedand priveledged communities who would benefit from a helpful, insightful, skillful designer who can help promote their needs.
